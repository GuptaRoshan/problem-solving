# Recursion Patterns

**1. Direct Recursion or Linear Recursion**

- A function calls itself once with a subset of the original input.
  > **subset of the original input** in the context of linear recursion means that each recursive call to the function works with a part of the data derived from the original input, typically a smaller or reduced version.

**2. Tail Recursion**

- A special kind of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. This allows for optimizations by the compiler or interpreter, making the recursion more efficient in terms of memory usage.
- Only one stack frame is created.

**3. Tree Recursion**

- A type of recursion where a function makes multiple recursive calls. This creates a branching effect, like the branches of a tree.

**4. Divide and Conquer**

- The divide and conquer pattern is a powerful algorithmic technique where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems that are solved recursively.

**5. Backtracking**

- Explore all potential solutions and backtrack when a solution fails.
  - Example: Solving puzzles like Sudoku, N-Queens problem.

**6. Dynamic Programming (with Recursion)**

- Recursion combined with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
  - Example: Fibonacci sequence with memoization, Knapsack problem.

**7. Mutual Recursion**

- Mutual recursion is when two or more functions recursively call each other. A classic example involves checking whether a number is even or odd using mutual recursion.

**8. Generative Recursion**

- Generative recursion involves generating and solving new subproblems based on the current state, often used in scenarios like generating permutations.

**9. Indirect Recursion**

- A function calls another function, eventually leading to the original function being called.
  - Example: Function A calls Function B, and Function B calls Function A.

**10. Nested Recursion**

- Nested recursion occurs when a recursive function calls itself with a recursive call as one of its arguments.

# Deque Usage

1. **Implementing Both Stack and Queue Operations**
   
   - As a Stack: You can use methods like addFirst() and removeFirst() to add and remove elements from the front, mimicking stack behavior.
   - As a Queue: You can use methods like addLast() and removeFirst() to enqueue and dequeue elements, mimicking queue behavior.

3. **Sliding Window Problems**
   
    - Deque is particularly useful in algorithms that require a sliding window over a sequence of data. For example, in finding the maximum or minimum in a sliding window over an array, a Deque can efficiently maintain the window's elements, allowing constant-time access to the window's maximum or minimum.

5. **Palindrome Checking**
   
   - You can use a Deque to check if a string is a palindrome. By pushing characters onto the Deque and then popping from both ends, you can compare characters from the front and back to determine if they are the same.

7. **Undo and Redo Operations**
   - In applications with undo and redo functionalities, a Deque can store the history of actions. The front of the Deque can store actions for undo, while the back can store actions for redo.

8. **Expression Parsing**
   
   - In parsing expressions, especially for balancing parentheses or evaluating postfix expressions, a Deque can be used to temporarily hold operands and operators.

10. **BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search)**
    
    - In graph traversal algorithms, a Deque can be used to manage the frontier. For BFS, you can use it as a queue, and for DFS, you can use it as a stack.

11. **Handling a Fixed Number of Recent Elements**
    
    - When you need to maintain a fixed number of recent elements, a Deque can be used to implement a circular buffer. By adding elements to the back and removing elements from the front, you can keep the buffer up to date with the most recent data.

13. **Job Scheduling**
 
    - In systems that require scheduling tasks or jobs, a Deque can help manage tasks that can be added and removed from either end, providing flexibility in task management.

# Stack Techniques

1. **Monotonic Stack**

   - A stack that maintains elements in a strictly increasing or decreasing order
   - Used for problems involving finding the next greater/smaller element or calculating spans

   **How it works:**

   - Iterate through the elements
   - For each element, pop elements from the stack that violate the monotonic property
   - Push the current element onto the stack
   - The elements remaining in the stack after processing all elements often represent the solution

2. **Paired Brackets Matching**

   - Used for validating or processing strings with paired brackets or parentheses

   **How it works:**

   - Push opening brackets onto the stack
   - When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack
   - If it matches, pop the top element; if not, the string is invalid
   - After processing all characters, the stack should be empty for a valid string

3. **Expression Evaluation**

   - Used for evaluating arithmetic expressions, especially those in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

   **How it works:**

   - For RPN: Push operands onto the stack
   - When an operator is encountered, pop the required number of operands, apply the operator, and push the result back
   - The final result is the top of the stack after processing all tokens

4. **Backtracking with Stack**

   - Used for problems that require exploring paths or combinations with the ability to backtrack

   **How it works:**

   - Push states or choices onto the stack as you explore
   - When backtracking, pop the stack to return to the previous state
   - Continue until all possibilities are explored

5. **Stack for Tree Traversal**

   - Used for implementing iterative versions of tree traversal algorithms

   **How it works:**

   - Push nodes onto the stack as you traverse
   - Pop nodes to process them
   - The order of pushing and processing determines the type of traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order)

# Linked List Techniques

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**

   - Uses two pointers moving at different speeds or starting at different positions
   - Useful for detecting cycles, finding middle elements, or identifying intersections

   **How it works:**

   - Initialize two pointers, often called "slow" and "fast"
   - Move the pointers through the list at different rates
   - The relative position or meeting point of the pointers provides the solution

2. **Dummy Node**

   - Uses a dummy node as the head of the list to simplify edge cases
   - Particularly useful in problems involving list manipulation or merging

   **How it works:**

   - Create a dummy node and set it as the head of the new list
   - Perform operations on the list, starting from the dummy node
   - Return the next node of the dummy node as the head of the resulting list

3. **Reverse Linked List**

   - A fundamental operation used in many linked list problems
   - Can be done iteratively or recursively

   **How it works:**

   - _Iterative:_ Use three pointers (prev, current, next) to reverse links as you traverse
   - _Recursive:_ Recursively reverse the rest of the list and fix the head

4. **Merge Lists**

   - Combines two or more sorted linked lists into a single sorted list
   - Often used as a subproblem in more complex list manipulations

   **How it works:**

   - Compare the heads of the lists
   - Choose the smaller head and move it to the result list
   - Repeat until all lists are exhausted

5. **Fast and Slow Pointers**

   - When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle

6. **Sentinel Node**

   - Similar to the dummy node, used to simplify edge cases
   - Particularly useful in problems involving deletion or insertion

# Heap and Priority Queue Techniques

1. **Basic Heap Operations**

   **Concept**

   A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node, the node's value is greater than or equal to the values of its children. In a min heap, the node's value is less than or equal to the values of its children.

   **Key Operations**

   - Insertion: O(log n)
   - Deletion of top element: O(log n)
   - Peek top element: O(1)
   - Heapify (building a heap from an array): O(n)

   **How it works**

   - Heaps are typically implemented as arrays, where for any element at index i:
   - Its left child is at index 2i + 1
   - Its right child is at index 2i + 2
   - Its parent is at index (i - 1) / 2
   - When inserting or deleting, the heap property is maintained by "bubbling up" or "sinking down" elements.

2. **K-th Largest/Smallest Element**

   **Technique**

   Use a min heap for K-th largest, or a max heap for K-th smallest.

   **How it works**

   - For K-th largest:

   1. Maintain a min heap of size K.
   2. Iterate through all elements:
      - If heap size < K, add the element.
      - If current element > heap top, remove top and add current element.
   3. The top of the heap is the K-th largest element.

3. **Merge K Sorted Lists/Arrays**

   **Technique**

   Use a min heap to efficiently merge multiple sorted sequences.

   **How it works**

   1. Create a min heap and insert the first element from each list along with its list identifier.
   2. While the heap is not empty:

   - Extract the minimum element (this is the next element in the merged sequence).
   - If the list this element came from is not exhausted, insert its next element into the heap.

   3. Time complexity: O(N log K), where N is the total number of elements and K is the number of lists.

4. **Sliding Window Problems**

   **Technique**
   Use a heap to maintain the maximum or minimum within a sliding window.

   **How it works**

   1. Use a heap to store elements within the current window.
   2. As the window slides:

   - Remove elements that are no longer in the window.
   - Add the new element entering the window.
   - The top of the heap represents the max/min of the current window.

   3. To handle element removal efficiently, you might need to pair each value with its index in the heap.

5. **Top K Frequent Elements**

   **Technique**

   Use a hash map for counting and a heap for selecting top K.

   **How it works**

   1. Use a hash map to count the frequency of each element.
   2. Use a min heap of size K to keep track of the K most frequent elements:
      - If heap size < K, add the element.
      - If current element's frequency > heap top's frequency, remove top and add current element.
   3. The heap will contain the K most frequent elements.
   4. Time complexity: O(N log K), where N is the number of elements.

6. **Median in a Stream of Integers**

   **Technique**

   Use two heaps: a max heap for the lower half and a min heap for the upper half.

   **How it works**

   1. Maintain two heaps:

   - A max heap for the lower half of the numbers.
   - A min heap for the upper half of the numbers.

   2. Balance the heaps so their sizes differ by at most 1.
   3. When a new number comes in:

   - Add to the appropriate heap.
   - Rebalance if necessary by moving the top element from one heap to the other.

   4. The median is either the top of the max heap (if it's larger) or the average of both tops.

7. **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)**

   **Technique**
   Use a min heap (priority queue) to always process the vertex with the smallest known distance.

   **How it works**

   1. Initialize distances to all vertices as infinite, except the start vertex (distance = 0).
   2. Push the start vertex into the min heap.
   3. While the heap is not empty:

   - Extract the vertex with minimum distance.
   - For each neighbor of this vertex:
     - Calculate the distance through the current vertex.
     - If this distance is less than the previously known distance, update it and push the neighbor onto the heap.

   4. Time complexity: O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.


### General Approach to Heap/Priority Queue Problems

1. **Identify if a heap is suitable:**

   - Problems involving finding top K elements, sorting, or maintaining a dynamic set of elements where you frequently need the max/min.

2. **Choose between min heap and max heap:**

   - Min heap for problems where you need to repeatedly find and remove the smallest element.
   - Max heap for problems where you need to repeatedly find and remove the largest element.

3. **Consider using two heaps:**

   - Useful for problems like finding the median in a stream of numbers.

4. **Pair values with additional information:**

   - Often useful to store pairs (value, index) or (value, frequency) in the heap.

5. **Be mindful of time complexity:**

   - Insertion and deletion operations are O(log n), where n is the size of the heap.
   - Building a heap from an array is O(n).

6. **Use with other data structures:**

   - Heaps are often used in combination with hash maps, especially for frequency-based problems.

7. **Custom comparators:**

   - For complex objects, define custom comparison logic to determine heap ordering.

8. **Lazy deletion:**

   - In some cases, it's more efficient to mark elements as deleted rather than removing them immediately.

9. **Space-time trade-off:**

   - Heaps can often provide a good balance between time efficiency and space usage.

10. **Practice and learn patterns:**
    - Many heap problems share similar structures. Recognizing these patterns can speed up problem-solving.

</br>

# Backtracking Techniques

1. **Basic Backtracking Structure**

   **How it works:**

   - Start with an initial state or partial solution.
   - Recursively explore possible candidates to build the solution.
   - If a candidate leads to a valid solution, add it to the result.
   - If a candidate doesn't lead to a valid solution, backtrack (undo the last choice) and try the next candidate.
   - Continue this process until all possibilities have been explored.

   The key components are:

   1. A method to check if the current state is a valid solution.
   2. A way to generate candidate choices for the next step.
   3. A mechanism to apply and undo changes to the current state.
   4. A recursive function that ties all these components together.

2. **Pruning in Backtracking**

   **How it works**

   - Before fully exploring a branch, check if it can potentially lead to a valid solution.
   - If the branch cannot possibly lead to a valid solution, skip it entirely.
   - This is typically implemented by adding conditions before the recursive call.
   - Pruning can significantly reduce the number of explored states, improving efficiency.

3. **State Space Tree**

   **How it works**

   - Conceptualize the problem as a tree where:
   - Each node represents a partial solution or state.
   - Edges represent choices or decisions.
   - Leaf nodes are either complete solutions or dead ends.
   - Traverse this tree using depth-first search.
   - Backtracking occurs when you reach a leaf node and need to explore other branches.

4. **Backtracking with Memoization**

   **How it works:**

   - Combine backtracking with dynamic programming techniques.
   - Store the results of subproblems in a data structure (often a hash map).
   - Before solving a subproblem, check if its result is already stored.
   - If found, use the stored result instead of recomputing.
   - This optimization is particularly useful when the same subproblems are encountered multiple times during backtracking.

5. **Iterative Backtracking**

   **How it works:**

   - Instead of using recursion, use a stack to manage the states.
   - Push initial state onto the stack.
   - While the stack is not empty:
   - Pop a state from the stack.
   - If it's a solution, process it.
   - If not, generate new candidate states and push them onto the stack.
   - This approach avoids potential stack overflow issues in deep recursions.
   - It can be more complex to implement but may be necessary for very deep search trees.

### General Approach to Backtracking Problems

1. **Identify the problem structure:**

   - Determine if the problem requires finding all solutions or just one
   - Identify the constraints and validity conditions

2. **Define the state:**

   - Determine what information needs to be maintained in each state
   - Design a suitable data structure to represent the state

3. **Implement the backtracking function:**

   - Define base cases (solution found or dead end)
   - Implement the recursive exploration of possibilities

4. **Optimize with pruning:**

   - Identify conditions that allow early termination of a branch
   - Implement checks to skip invalid paths early

5. **Consider time and space complexity:**

   - Analyze the branching factor and depth of the search tree
   - Look for opportunities to reduce redundant computations

6. **Test with small examples:**

   - Verify the algorithm with simple, known cases
   - Gradually increase complexity to test robustness

7. **Debug systematically:**

   - Use print statements or debuggers to visualize the backtracking process
   - Verify that all valid solutions are being generated and no invalid ones are included

8. **Consider iterative implementation:**

   - If stack overflow is a concern, convert the recursive solution to an iterative one

9. **Optimize for specific problem requirements:**

   - If only one solution is needed, consider adding early termination
   - If counting solutions is sufficient, avoid storing all solutions explicitly

10. **Practice and learn patterns:**
    - Many backtracking problems share similar structures
    - Recognizing these patterns can speed up problem-solving in the future

# Bit Manipulation

### Bitwise effects on numbers

```java

    /*
    * Left Shift (<<) :
    * The left shift operator (<<) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.

### Check if a Number is Even or Odd

```java

// Input Examples:
// isEven(4):
// 4 in binary: 0100
// 4 & 1: 0100 & 0001 = 0000 (result is 0, so 4 is even)

// isEven(7):
// 7 in binary: 0111
// 7 & 1: 0111 & 0001 = 0001 (result is 1, so 7 is odd)

// 1 << 1 (shift left by 1): 0010
// 10 | 2: 1010 | 0010 = 1010 (result is 10)

public int setBit(int number, int bitPosition) {
    return number | (1 << bitPosition);
}

```

`It means setting 0 at a specific bit position (using AND and Complement )`

```java

// Input Examples:
// clearBit(7, 1):
// 7 in binary: 0111
// ~(1 << 1) (shift left by 1 and complement): ~0010 = 1101
// 7 & 1101: 0111 & 1101 = 0101 (result is 5)

// clearBit(15, 3):
// 15 in binary: 1111
// ~(1 << 3) (shift left by 3 and complement): ~1000 = 0111

// isPowerOfTwo(6):
// 6 in binary: 0110
// 6 - 1 = 5 (binary: 0101)
// 6 & 5: 0110 & 0101 = 0100 (result is not 0, so 6 is not a power of two)

}

```

### Swap Two Numbers Without Using a Temporary Variable

// Before swap: [3, 5]
// 3 ^ 5 = 6 (0110)
// 5 ^ 6 = 3
// 6 ^ 3 = 5
// After swap: [5, 3]

// arr = [7, 2]; swap(arr, 0, 1);
// Before swap: [7, 2]
// 7 ^ 2 = 5 (0101)
// 2 ^ 5 = 7
// 5 ^ 7 = 2
// After swap: [2, 7]

public void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
    if (i != j) {

# Matrix

### Basic Directions (left, right, top, down)

- `{0, 1}` : Represents movement to the right
- `{0, -1}`: Represents movement to the left
- `{1, 0}` : Represents movement downwards
- `{-1, 0}`: Represents movement upwards

### Additional diagonal movements

- `{1, 1}` : Represents movement diagonally down and to the right
- `{1, -1}` : Represents movement diagonally down and to the left
- `{-1, 1}` : Represents movement diagonally up and to the right
- `{-1, -1}`: Represents movement diagonally up and to the left

### Matrix Conversion

Convert `n * m` matrix to an array : `a[row * m + col] = matrix[row][col]`

```java
    public static int[] matrixToArray(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int[] array = new int[m * n];

        for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
                array[row * n + col] = matrix[row][col];
            }
        }
        return array;
    }
```

Convert array to `n * m` matrix : `matrix[x / m][x % m] = a[x]`;

```java
public static int[][] arrayToMatrix(int[] array, int n, int m) {
        int[][] matrix = new int[n][m];

        for (int x = 0; x < array.length; x++) {
            matrix[x / m][x % m] = array[x];
        }
        return matrix;
    }
```

### Grid Number in matrix

gridNumber = `(row / 3) * 3 + (col / 3)`
