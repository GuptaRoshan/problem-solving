/*
 * Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
 * in a weighted, undirected graph.
 *
 * Kruskal's algorithm builds the MST by selecting edges with the smallest
 * weight first, as long as they don't create a cycle.
 *
 * Analogy:
 * Imagine you building a road network connecting several cities.
 * You want to use the least amount of road material (minimize total road length)
 * while ensuring all cities are connected. Kruskal's algorithm would start
 * by building the shortest roads first, gradually connecting all cities.
