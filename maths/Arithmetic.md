#### 1. Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

1. **Addition (+)**: Combining two or more quantities.
   - **Example**: If you have 3 apples and you buy 2 more, how many apples do you have? 
     - **Calculation**: `3 + 2 = 5` apples.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Adding items to a shopping cart. If you add 2 shirts and 3 pants, you have 5 items in total.

2. **Subtraction (−)**: Finding the difference between two quantities.
   - **Example**: If you had 10 dollars and spent 4 dollars, how much money do you have left?
     - **Calculation**: `10 - 4 = 6` dollars.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Budgeting. If you have a budget of $100 and spend $30 on groceries, you have $70 left.

3. **Multiplication (×)**: Repeated addition of the same number.
   - **Example**: If you have 4 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies, how many cookies do you have in total?
     - **Calculation**: `4 × 6 = 24` cookies.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Calculating total costs. If one book costs $20 and you want to buy 5 books, the total cost is `5 × 20 = 100` dollars.

4. **Division (÷)**: Splitting a quantity into equal parts.
   - **Example**: If you have 20 candies and want to share them equally among 4 friends, how many candies will each friend get?
     - **Calculation**: `20 ÷ 4 = 5` candies per friend.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Sharing resources. If you have 100 units of a product and need to distribute them equally among 5 stores, each store will get `100 ÷ 5 = 20` units.

#### 2. Fractions and Decimals

1. **Fractions**: A part of a whole, represented as `numerator/denominator`.
   - **Example**: If a pizza is cut into 8 slices and you eat 3 slices, the fraction of the pizza you ate is `3/8`.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Cooking. A recipe might require `1/2` cup of sugar. Understanding fractions helps in measuring ingredients accurately.

2. **Decimals**: Another way to represent fractions, using a decimal point.
   - **Example**: The fraction `1/2` can also be written as `0.5`.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Financial transactions. Prices are often in decimals, such as $10.99. Understanding decimals is crucial when making purchases or managing accounts.

#### 3. Percentages and Ratios

1. **Percentages (%)**: A fraction of 100.
   - **Example**: If you scored 75 out of 100 on a test, your score is 75%.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Discounts during shopping. If an item costs $100 and is on a 20% discount, the new price is `$100 - ($100 × 0.20) = $80`.

2. **Ratios**: A relationship between two numbers, showing how many times one value contains or is contained within the other.
   - **Example**: If there are 2 teachers for every 30 students, the ratio of teachers to students is `2:30` or simplified to `1:15`.
   - **Real-World Use Case**: Recipe adjustments. If a recipe is for 4 people and you need to cook for 8, you use a ratio of `1:2` to double the ingredients.

####  Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

The order in which you solve an equation with basic arithmetic operations is determined by the **order of operations**, commonly remembered by the acronym **PEMDAS**:

- **P**: Parentheses
- **E**: Exponents (including powers and square roots)
- **MD**: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- **AS**: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

**Order of Operations Explained**

1. **Parentheses (P)**
   - Solve any operations inside parentheses first.
   - **Example**: In `3 × (2 + 4)`, calculate `2 + 4` first to get `3 × 6 = 18`.

2. **Exponents (E)**
   - Next, solve any exponents or powers.
   - **Example**: In `2^3 + 5`, calculate `2^3 = 8` first, then add 5 to get `8 + 5 = 13`.

3. **Multiplication and Division (MD)**
   - Perform multiplication and division as they appear from left to right.
   - **Example**: In `6 ÷ 2 × 3`, perform `6 ÷ 2 = 3` first, then `3 × 3 = 9`.

4. **Addition and Subtraction (AS)**
   - Finally, perform addition and subtraction as they appear from left to right.
   - **Example**: In `7 + 4 - 2`, perform `7 + 4 = 11` first, then `11 - 2 = 9`.
